# Adventure-Game

Technology used :
- Python
- MySql database
- Javascript (Jquery framework)
- HTML/CSS



Creation of an aventure game when the user choices lead him/her through a different storyline. 
The user enters the game by entering his/her name and he/she starts the adventure. 
According to the choice that the player do, he/she can loose money/life. 
This game includes 4 steps that lead you to a conclusion concerning your state.

This project is a good one to start working on FullStack Development. It involves using database and understanding the flow between:
- Database
- Python
- Javascript and finally HTML to display the results to the user.

IMPORTANT : To use this code, it is mandatory to download the adventure.sql database (in the Git).

To run this database I personally used WAMP, free software that you can easily download online. 
Easily upload the database, once WAMP is downloaded.


1. Fork or Download the ZIP file
2. Install WAMP software and upload the Mysql file 
3. Launch the project

Do not hesitate to give me any feed-back :)
